## Instructions

Download index.html, app.css, app.js, and the supporting images and then simply open the index.html file in your browser to start playing. 

Click on one card to turn it over, and then click another to see if they match. If it's a match the cards will stay face-up, but if not, they will be hidden once more. The goal of the game is to match every card in the shortest amount of time. 

## Contributing

Just shoot me a pull request if you'd like to tinker with my code. I'm aware that there may be some issues in the code at the moment. It is still a work in progress.
